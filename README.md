# DC Parking

A shapefile with one point for every Residential Permit Parking (RPP) spot in DC: [output/parking_spots_narrowed.geojson](output/parking_spots_narrowed.geojson)

This data is an estimate based off of street segments that are identified as being in the RPP program. 

Points that are near to street intersections, fire hydrants, and parking meters are excluded as they are not likely RPP parking spots.
